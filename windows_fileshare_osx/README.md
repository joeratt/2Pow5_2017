# Windows Fileshare -- OS X

This script is a quick utility for connecting to a Windows Fileshare from OS X. This utility allows users to easily connect to `\\my\server\abc` by entering the URL in the prompt.

This program eliminates the need to reverse slashes, add "smb:" at the beginning, and remember how to open a fileshare in Finder. Just copy/paste that Windows Fileshare URL in to the prompt.

This can be added to your user scripts to be easily-accessable within your OS X titlebar.

How to use:
* Open `AppleScript Editor` (a.k.a. `Script Editor`) program
  * Open the "Preferences..." option (Ttile Bar -> Script Editor -> Preferences...)
  * Check "Show Script menu in menu bar"
* From the "Script Menu" (mine is next to the wifi indicator):
  * Open the "User Scripts Folder"
    * Open Scripts Folder -> Open User Scripts Folder
* Copy this script in to the opened folder
* Profit
