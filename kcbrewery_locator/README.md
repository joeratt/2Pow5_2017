When we brewed our first batch of beer we never imagined where it would take us. The passion that was created for brewing these unique full flavored beers became intoxicating to all of us. This dream has been 3 years in the making and took a bit of luck and a lot of hard work.

It’s hard to believe we started small at our homes and have now grown into our 15bbl facility with a full taproom and barrel aging program. We haven’t forgotten our roots as we continue to focus on unique full flavored beers with plenty of character and a whole lot of attitude. We strive to share a truly unique experience in every glass of Cinder Block Beer.
